# Team Dev Agents

> A multi-agent AI development team for analyzing and building SaaS products

## Overview

This repository contains a specialized AI agent system built on Claude Code that acts as a complete development team. When analyzing a SaaS project, five specialized agents work in parallel to provide comprehensive insights:

- **🏗️ SaaS Architect** - System architecture, scalability, and technology stack
- **🎨 UI/UX Designer** - User experience analysis and design recommendations
- **💻 Backend Lead Engineer** - API design, database architecture, and integrations
- **🖥️ Frontend Lead Engineer** - Component architecture and frontend strategy
- **📊 Development Team Lead** - Strategic roadmap, go-to-market, and business analysis

## Features

- **Parallel Agent Execution** - All 5 agents run simultaneously for fast results
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Architecture, UX, backend, frontend, and business strategy
- **Real Project Analysis** - Agents can analyze live websites and GitHub repositories
- **Actionable Outputs** - Detailed roadmaps, cost estimates, and implementation plans
- **Italian Market Expertise** - Specialized knowledge of Italian SaaS market and compliance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Access to Claude API (Sonnet 4)

### Usage

1. Open this repository in Claude Code
2. Provide a project description or URL to analyze
3. Run the analysis:

```bash
# The agents will automatically run in parallel
# Example command (from Claude Code):
"Analyze this SaaS project: [description or URL]"
```

4. Review the comprehensive reports generated by each agent

### Example Analysis

See the `reports/` directory for a complete example analysis of **Ospitly** (Italian B&B tax compliance SaaS):

- Market opportunity: €13.6B by 2028
- Architecture recommendations: Node.js + PostgreSQL on AWS Milan
- UX priorities: Mobile-first, trust signals, compliance tracking
- Strategic roadmap: 3 phases from MVP to €900K ARR

## Real-World Example: Ospitly Analysis

Complete analysis of Ospitly (www.ospitly.it), an Italian B&B tax compliance SaaS:

### Key Findings
- **Market Potential**: €13.6B vacation rental market by 2028
- **Competition**: No dominant player serving property owners directly
- **Tech Stack**: Recommended Node.js + PostgreSQL on AWS Milan
- **Investment**: €660K Year 1, breakeven Month 6
- **Success Probability**: 70-80% (highly attractive)

### Deliverables Generated
- 94-page architecture assessment
- 20-page UX/UI analysis
- 18-page backend implementation plan
- 17-page frontend roadmap
- 79-page strategic business plan

**Total Analysis Time**: ~5 minutes with parallel agent execution

## Future Vision: DevTeam.AI

This agent system is the foundation for a future web application that would:

1. Accept project descriptions via web form
2. Run all agents automatically in the background
3. Present interactive reports in a dashboard
4. Offer PDF exports and email delivery
5. Provide AI chat for follow-up questions

**Potential Business Model**:
- Free tier: 1 analysis/month
- Starter ($49/mo): 5 analyses + PDF export
- Pro ($149/mo): 20 analyses + AI chat + history
- Team ($399/mo): 100 analyses + collaboration
