# Analysis Reports

This directory contains the output reports generated by the AI development team agents.

## Report Types

Each analysis generates five comprehensive reports:

1. **saas-architect-report.md** - System architecture, scalability, and infrastructure recommendations
2. **ui-ux-designer-report.md** - User experience analysis and design strategy
3. **backend-engineer-report.md** - Database schema, API design, and backend implementation
4. **frontend-engineer-report.md** - Component architecture and frontend development plan
5. **team-lead-report.md** - Strategic roadmap, business model, and go-to-market strategy

- **94 pages** of architecture assessment
